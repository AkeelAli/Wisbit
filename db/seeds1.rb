Quote.create(:quote=>"Dear Sir: In the affair of so much importance to you wherein you ask my advice, I cannot, for want of sufficient premises, advise you what to determine, but if you please I will tell you how. When these difficult cases occur, they are difficult chiefly because while we have them under consideration, all the reasons pro and con are not present to the mind at the same time; but sometimes one set present themselves, and at other time another, the first being out of sight. Hence the various purposes or inclinations that alternately prevail, and the uncertainty that perplexes us. To get over this, my way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns; writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then during three or four days consideration I put down under the different head short hints of the different motives that at different times occur to me, for or against the measure. When I have thus got them all together in one view, I endeavor to estimate their respective weights; and where I find two (one on each side) that seem equal, I strike them both out. If I find reason pro equal to some two reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two reasons con equal to some three reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the balance lies; and if after a day or two of further consideration, nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side I come to a determination accordingly. And though the weight of reasons cannot be taken with the precision of algebraic quantities, yet when each is thus considered separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, I think I can judge better, and am less likely to make a rash step; and in fact I have found great advantage from this kind of equation in what may be called moral or prudential algebra.

Quote.create(:quote=>"La Rochefoucault, the French philosopher, said: \"If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.\" Why is this true? Because when our friends excel us, that gives them a feeling of importance; but when we excel them, that gives them a feeling of inferiority and arouses envy and jealousy. The Germans have a proverb: \"Die reinste Freude ist die Schadenfreude,\" which, being interpreted, goes something like this: \"The purest joy is the malicious joy we take in the misfortunes of those we have envied.\" Or, to put it another way: \"The purest joy is the joy we take in other people's troubles.\" Yes, some of your friends probably get more satisfaction out of your troubles than out of your triumphs. So let's minimize our achievements. Let's be modest. That always makes a hit. Irvin Cobb had the right technique. A lawyer once said to Cobb on the witness stand: \"I understand, Mr. Cobb, that you are one of the most famous writers in America. Is that correct?\" \"I have probably been more fortunate that I deserve,\" Cobb replied. We ought to be modest, for neither you nor I amount to much. Both of us will pass on and be completely forgotten a century from now. Life is too short to bore other people with talk of our petty accomplishments. Let's encourage them to to talk instead.", :score=> 0, :category_id=>15, :matchups => 0)
