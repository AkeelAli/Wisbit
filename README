Note when seeding: make sure that your categories table is reset with ID starting at 1. To set this, you must rake db:migrate:redo VERSION=<timestamp>, replacing the timestamp with that of the create categories migration. If that doesn't work, then change the timestamp on the create categories migration to something recent, and run rake db:migrate. Once you've ensured that the IDs start at 1, only then can you run rake db:seed
